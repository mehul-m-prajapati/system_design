# System Design

This repository contains a collection of **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** problems and solutions. It is intended to help engineers, developers, and system architects improve their system design skills through practical examples and detailed explanations.

## Contents

- **High-Level Design (HLD)**: 
  - Concepts, patterns, and solutions for designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems. 
  - Examples of designing distributed systems, microservices, databases, and more.

- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: 
  - Focuses on detailed design aspects, including classes, objects, and interactions within components.
  - Covers topics such as UML diagrams, class design, API design, and more.

## Features

- A comprehensive collection of HLD and LLD problems based on real-world scenarios.
- Step-by-step breakdowns of design decisions and trade-offs.
- UML diagrams and class-level design details for easy understanding.
- Code snippets and practical solutions for implementation.
- Discussion of system scalability, performance considerations, and fault tolerance.

## Topics Covered

- **High-Level Design**:
  - System architecture patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven architecture)
  - Scalability and high availability
  - Load balancing and caching strategies
  - Fault tolerance and disaster recovery
  - Database design and sharding

- **Low-Level Design**:
  - Object-oriented design principles (e.g., SOLID)
  - Class and sequence diagrams
  - API design and RESTful services
  - Data modeling and relational/non-relational databases
  - Caching and optimization strategies
